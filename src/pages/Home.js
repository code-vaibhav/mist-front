          MIST is a general-purpose classical simulation software. We have
          developed C++ object-oriented programming software for doing various
          Monte Carlo simulations such as NPT, NVT, GCMC, TMMC etc. Monte Carlo
          simulation is clearly an efficient way to study gas adsorption, gas
          separation in nanoporous materials and phase diagram calculation.
          Hence the development is entirely focused on running simulations
          faster with minimum input details from the users. Our software is used
          along with machine learning models to predict the best materials from
          h-MOF database for ethane / ethylene separation.

          It has been actively developed by the Computational Nanoscience Group
          led by Prof. Jayant K. Singh at the Indian Institute of Technology,
          Kanpur for over five years. It has been used for publication purposes
          in peer reviewed journals, primarily as a tool for Monte Carlo
          simulations. In particular, it has been used for the simulation of
          molecules in the gaseous or fluid phase, in conjunction with
          adsorbents.
